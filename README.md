# DFA-Recognizer

A Deterministic Finite Automata recognizer using Racket:
Reads on stdin a DFA followed by followed by several additional lines of input. 
Each additional line of input is a string of alphabet symbols separated by spaces.
For each string, the program prints true if the string is in the language, and false if it is not.
